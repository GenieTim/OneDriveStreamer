# OneDriveStreamer
Stream Movies from OneDrive with this App for XBox (&amp; Windows)

## Why?

- The OneDrive App for XBox does not allow to access media controls (pause/play, time in movie, etc.)
- Edge stops playing movies after ca. 1:40. 
- No file manager on newer devices means, that downloading & delting after viewing is not easy/possible either

## How to Use

Currently, this is not a finished product and equivalently not published in any store.
To run/test/contribute, you need to create a file `OneDriveStreamer/appsettings.json` with a 
content of:

```json
{
  "clientId": "some-string-you-need-to-get-yourself"
}
```

## Current State

To be updated.
At the time of writing, it runs, but UX & UI are not ideal.
